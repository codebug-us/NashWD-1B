## DREAM VACATION WEBSITE
[TERMINAL HELP](https://github.com/sarah-codebug/NashWD-1A)

#### Your mission is create a webpage for your dream vacation.
1. Find a spot where you would like to vacation 
2. Via the terminal, create a new folder on your desktop called `coding`.
3. `cd` into your `coding` folder and create another folder called `NashWD-1B`
4. `cd` into your `NashWD-1B` folder and create a `dream-vacay.html` file.
4. Use the `subl` command to open the file in Sublime. 
5. Click on the `dream-vacay.html` file, type `html` in the file, and hit `tab`. 
    * If that didn't autofill html for you, copy and paste this into your html file: 
    ``` HTML
      <!DOCTYPE html>     
      <html>
         <head>
           <title></title>
         </head>
         <body>
         </body>
      </html>
    ```
6. Add a title for your page in the `title` html element with the name of your recipe. 
7. Use `open dream-vacay.html` or `start dream-vacay.html` on windows from your terminal to see your file in your web browser!

# THE CODE
> Don't worry if your vacation site doesn't look great, you'll be adding the styles later. 

Your vacation page must include the following:

* A header with the name of your destination.
* A paragraph explaining some attraction and/or fun facts about your destination.
* A picture of the destination. Or many pictures if you'd like!
* An unordered list of some sort (local attractions, animals in the area...).
* An ordered list (best restaurants, best hotels, best beaches).
* Links to 3 other similar destinations to suggest to your visitors.
* Create a form that allows people to write a comment on your page. 
> *HINT!!! you will be using `<form method="post">` don't worry about the `action` attribute yet, we'll talk about those later! [Here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp) is a good example

#### EXTENSION

* A `<table>` of expenses summarizing how much this trip would cost. (You can make these up if you would like to! A luxurious trip to Paris for $5.00 :)) 
> *Check out this image if you need inspiration* ![table](/table-image.png) 
* Begin styling your website!

    * Note: You'll need to create a `style.css` page for your CSS styling.
    * Once you've created `style.css` you need to link your CSS file to our HTML file. If you've forgotten how to do that, check out this [link](https://teamtreehouse.com/community/htmlcss-linking).
